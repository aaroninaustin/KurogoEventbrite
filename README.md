KurogoEventbrite
================

Kurogo Module that uses the Eventbrite API

This is a simple module that gets events from the Eventbrite API and then links to the event. 

To do:

 * Tweak the search funciton. Needs organizer filter.
 * Use locaiton to show event on map.
 * Highlight Live or Nearby events
 * Show attendee list? Not sure if this is a good one :/
